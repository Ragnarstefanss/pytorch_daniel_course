    "PyTorch has four (give or take) essential modules you can use to create almost any kind of neural network you can imagine.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are [`torch.nn`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.html), [`torch.optim`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html), [`torch.utils.data.Dataset`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#torch.utils.data.Dataset) and [`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html). For now, we'll focus on the first two and get to the other two later (though you may be able to guess what they do).\n",

    "| [`torch.nn.Parameter`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parameter.Parameter.html#parameter) | Stores tensors that can be used with `nn.Module`. If `requires_grad=True` gradients (used for updating model parameters via [**gradient descent**](https://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gradient_descent.html))  are calculated automatically, this is often referred to as \"autograd\".  | \n",

If you're building a neural network in PyTorch, your models should subclass `nn.Module`. Requires a `forward()` method be implemented. | \n",
    "| [`torch.optim`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html) | Contains various optimization algorithms (these tell the model parameters stored in `nn.Parameter` how to best change to improve gradient descent and in turn reduce the loss). | \n",

    "* `forward()` tells the larger blocks how to make calculations on inputs (tensors full of data) within  `nn.Module`(s)\n",

    "* `lr` is the **learning rate** you'd like the optimizer to update the parameters at, higher means the optimizer will try larger updates (these can sometimes be too large and the optimizer will fail to work), lower means the optimizer will try smaller updates (these can sometimes be too small and the optimizer will take too long to find the ideal values). The learning rate is considered a **hyperparameter** (because it's set by a machine learning engineer). Common starting values for the learning rate are `0.01`, `0.001`, `0.0001`, however, these can also be adjusted over time (this is called [learning rate scheduling](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate)). \n",

    "Woohoo! Now we've got a loss function and an optimizer, it's now time to create a **training loop** (and **testing loop**).\n",
    "\n",
    "The training loop involves the model going through the training data and learning the relationships between the `features` and `labels`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing loop involves going through the testing data and evaluating how good the patterns are that the model learned on the training data (the model never see's the testing data during training).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these is called a \"loop\" because we want our model to look (loop through) at each sample in each dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create these we're going to write a Python `for` loop in the theme of the [unofficial PyTorch optimization loop song](https://twitter.com/mrdbourke/status/1450977868406673410?s=20) (there's a [video version too](https://youtu.be/Nutpusq_AFw)).\n",

    "\n",
    "If you've trained a PyTorch model, chances are you'll want to save it and export it somewhere.\n",

    "As in, you might train it on Google Colab or your local machine with a GPU but you'd like to now export it to some sort of application where others can use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Or maybe you'd like to save your progress on a model and come back and load it back later.\n",
    "\n",
    "For saving and loading models in PyTorch, there are three main methods you should be aware of (all of below have been taken from the [PyTorch saving and loading models guide](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#saving-loading-model-for-inference)):\n",
    "\n",
    "| PyTorch method | What does it do? | \n",
    "| ----- | ----- |\n",
    "| [`torch.save`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=save#torch.save) | Saves a serialzed object to disk using Python's [`pickle`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html) utility. Models, tensors and various other Python objects like dictionaries can be saved using `torch.save`.  | \n",
    "| [`torch.load`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html?highlight=torch%20load#torch.load) | Uses `pickle`'s unpickling features to deserialize and load pickled Python object files (like models, tensors or dictionaries) into memory. You can also set which device to load the object to (CPU, GPU etc). |\n",
    "| [`torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Module.html?highlight=load_state_dict#torch.nn.Module.load_state_dict)| Loads a model's parameter dictionary (`model.state_dict()`) using a saved `state_dict()` object. | \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** As stated in [Python's `pickle` documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html), the `pickle` module **is not secure**. That means you should only ever unpickle (load) data you trust. That goes for loading PyTorch models as well. Only ever use saved PyTorch models from sources you trust.\n"

    "The [recommended way](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html#saving-loading-model-for-inference) for saving and loading a model for inference (making predictions) is by saving and loading a model's `state_dict()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can do that in a few steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We'll create a directory for saving models to called `models` using Python's `pathlib` module.\n",
    "2. We'll create a file path to save the model to.\n",
    "3. We'll call `torch.save(obj, f)` where `obj` is the target model's `state_dict()` and `f` is the filename of where to save the model.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "All exercises have been inspired from code throughout the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one exercise per major section.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should be able to complete them by referencing their specific section.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** For all exercises, your code should be device agnostic (meaning it could run on CPU or GPU if it's available).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a straight line dataset using the linear regression formula (`weight * X + bias`).\n",
    "  * Set `weight=0.3` and `bias=0.9` there should be at least 100 datapoints total. \n",
    "  * Split the data into 80% training, 20% testing.\n",
    "  * Plot the training and testing data so it becomes visual.\n",
    "2. Build a PyTorch model by subclassing `nn.Module`. \n",
    "  * Inside should be a randomly initialized `nn.Parameter()` with `requires_grad=True`, one for `weights` and one for `bias`. \n",
    "  * Implement the `forward()` method to compute the linear regression function you used to create the dataset in 1. \n",
    "  * Once you've constructed the model, make an instance of it and check its `state_dict()`.\n",
    "  * **Note:** If you'd like to use `nn.Linear()` instead of `nn.Parameter()` you can.\n",
    "3. Create a loss function and optimizer using `nn.L1Loss()` and `torch.optim.SGD(params, lr)` respectively. \n",
    "  * Set the learning rate of the optimizer to be 0.01 and the parameters to optimize should be the model parameters from the model you created in 2.\n",
    "  * Write a training loop to perform the appropriate training steps for 300 epochs.\n",
    "  * The training loop should test the model on the test dataset every 20 epochs.\n",
    "4. Make predictions with the trained model on the test data.\n",
    "  * Visualize these predictions against the original training and testing data (**note:** you may need to make sure the predictions are *not* on the GPU if you want to use non-CUDA-enabled libraries such as matplotlib to plot).\n",
    "5. Save your trained model's `state_dict()` to file.\n",
    "  * Create a new instance of your model class you made in 2. and load in the `state_dict()` you just saved to it.\n",
    "  * Perform predictions on your test data with the loaded model and confirm they match the original model predictions from 4.\n",

    "## Extra-curriculum\n",
    "* Listen to [The Unofficial PyTorch Optimization Loop Song](https://youtu.be/Nutpusq_AFw) (to help remember the steps in a PyTorch training/testing loop).\n",
    "* Read [What is `torch.nn`, really?](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/nn_tutorial.html) by Jeremy Howard for a deeper understanding of how one of the most important modules in PyTorch works. \n",
    "* Spend 10-minutes scrolling through and checking out the [PyTorch documentation cheatsheet](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/ptcheat.html) for all of the different PyTorch modules you might come across.\n",
    "* Spend 10-minutes reading the [loading and saving documentation on the PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html) to become more familiar with the different saving and loading options in PyTorch. \n",
    "* Spend 1-2 hours read/watching the following for an overview of the internals of gradient descent and backpropagation, the two main algorithms that have been working in the background to help our model learn. \n",
